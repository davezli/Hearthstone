Runs a simulation to open packs with the following assumptions:
    1. All golden cards are disenchanted
    2. All copies of cards after 2 are disenchanted
    3. Rates are taken from http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_pack
The simulation will run until you have enough dust to craft all the cards you're missing.
Currently set up for TGT: constants near top of the file can be changed for GvG, Classic packs, etc.
